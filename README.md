## Quick presentation

Welcome to this draft dear unicorn student !

I am Elise, Ph.D. student since near to 4 years, and working on **the contribution of genetic to neurodevelopmental disorders** as autism. 
I don't really know if I fit in a specific domain. 

I currently work with genetic data (Copy Number Variant), clinical phenotypes (diagnosis and other related measures, e.g. SRS) and doing a lot of statistics and graphs (in R). But my initial formation was in neurosciences. 

I previously did a bachelor in Biomedical with a specialization in neurosciences, and did a Master in Cognitive Neurosciences where I used to work with multimodal data with a combination of Arterial Spin Labelling MRI data (preprocessing on Matlab and SPM) and Eye-tracking data. 

Since I started my Ph.D., I never used MRI data anymore, and I am here to take a revange on that. 

I am also an Open Sciences enthusiast!

**Skills:**
- Data management (feed me with multimodal data plz)
- Satistics
- Debugging codes

**Here to learn:**
- Universal languages to share science (such as BIDS nomenclature/tools)
- Machine/Deep learning (more complex stats!)
- Python libraries to change the R routine

## Project draft

Dunno what will be in this project yet. The ideal will be to play with clinical data or social cognition fMRI data (if available) in the aim to learn how to preprocessed fMRI data (or using derived fMRI data), as well as how to apply machine learning methodologies. If genetic data are also available, I am willing to add them to the analyses.
