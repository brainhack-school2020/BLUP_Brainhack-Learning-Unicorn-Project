Welcome to this draft dear unicorn student ! 

![Hello!](https://media.giphy.com/media/CzQ9Kl1UIt8hG/giphy.gif)

I am Elise, a Ph.D. student working on the contribution of genetic to neurodevelopmental disorders as autism. I don't really know if I fit in a specific domain. I work mostly with genetic data, clinical phenotypes and doing a lot of statistics and graphs.
