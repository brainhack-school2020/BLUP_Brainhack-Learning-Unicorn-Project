## Quick presentation

Welcome to this draft dear unicorn student !

I am Elise, Ph.D. student since near to 4 years, and working on **the contribution of genetic to neurodevelopmental disorders** as autism. [/!\ advertisment /!\ ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.979815v1.full) I don't really fit in a specific domain (genetic/cognitive neurosciences/psychology/neurosciences). I guess it what we call a unicorn student?

I currently work with genetic data, clinical phenotypes and doing a lot of statistics and graphs. But my initial formation was in cogitive neurosciences where I started to work with multimodal data (combination of Arterial Spin Labelling MRI data and Eye-tracking data).  

Since I started my Ph.D., I never used MRI data anymore, and I am here to take a revange on that. 

I am also an Open Sciences enthusiast!

**Skills:**
- Data management (feed me with multimodal data plz)
- Satistics
- Debugging codes

**Here to learn:**
- Universal languages and tools to share science 
- Machine/Deep learning (more complex stats!)
- Python libraries to change from the R routine

# Project draft: Brainhack Learning Unicorn Project

## Summary

There is no clear idea for this project yet. 
The ideal will be to play with multimodal data (derived anatomical MRI data, genetic, other clinical data) in the aim to learn how to apply deep learning models. 
The hypothesis will be basic, the focus will be on the best machine learning model for the multimodal data. 

## Background

### Problematic: 
1) Avoiding the transformation of the data 
2) Deal with missing values 

### Aims: 
Compare the model performances when infering a specific data categorization

## Tools 
- 
- Jupyter notebook to keep clear track of the project
- Compute Quebec to run the analyses on the complete sample
- Github to share the scripts and results 

## Data
