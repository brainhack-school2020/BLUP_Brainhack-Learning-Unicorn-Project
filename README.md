## Quick presentation

Welcome to this draft dear unicorn student !

I am Elise, Ph.D. student since near to 4 years, and working on **the contribution of genetic to neurodevelopmental disorders** as autism. [/!\ advertisment /!\ ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.979815v1.full) I don't really fit in a specific domain (genetic/cognitive neurosciences/psychology/neurosciences). I guess it what we call a unicorn student?

I currently work with genetic data, clinical phenotypes and doing a lot of statistics and graphs. But my initial formation was in cogitive neurosciences where I started to work with multimodal data (combination of Arterial Spin Labelling MRI data and Eye-tracking data).  

Since I started my Ph.D., I never used MRI data anymore, and I am here to take a revange on that. 

I am also an Open Sciences enthusiast!

**Skills:**
- Data management (feed me with multimodal data plz)
- Satistics
- Debugging codes

**Here to learn:**
- Universal languages and tools to share science 
- Machine/Deep learning (more complex stats!)
- Python libraries to change from the R routine

## Summary

Can a model predict if an individual is carrier of a pathogenic genetic variant based on Brain imagery derived data?
This project aims to feed a model with brains to predict if an individual is carrier of a pathogenic genetic variant (meaning that the DNA alteration is deleterious and formally associated to neurodevelopmental disorders and other psychiatric disorders).
The hypothesis is not based on strong assumptions, the focus will be on learning how to apply machine learning model for multimodal dataset (derived anatomical MRI data, genetic, other clinical data).


## Background

### Problematic: 
1) Avoiding the transformation of the data 
2) Deal with missing values 

### Aims: 

Compare the model performances when infering a specific data categorization

## Tools 
- 
- Jupyter notebook to keep clear track of the project
- Compute Quebec to run the analyses on the complete sample
- Github to share the scripts and results 

## Data
A first thought is to use data from UK Biobank:
- From the genetic side: Carriers of the most pathogenic CNVs vs. controls
- From the MRI side: All derived anatomical OR fMRI data from these individuals
- From the phenotypic part: sex, age, ... all the interesting data pertinent for the project
